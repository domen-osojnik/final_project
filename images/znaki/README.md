#What is the Difference Between Test and Validation Datasets?
A validation dataset is a sample of data held back from training your model that is used to give an estimate of model skill while tuning modelâ€™s hyperparameters.

The validation dataset is different from the test dataset that is also held back from the training of the model, but is instead used to give an unbiased estimate of the skill of the final tuned model when comparing or selecting between final models.
